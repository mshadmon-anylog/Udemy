## What is TypeScript: 
* A JavaScript (JS) superset -- it takes JS and adds ontop of it 
* It cannot be executed like JS 
* Programming Langugage + Compiler 
* Extra error checking instead of runtime errors

## Why Use TypeScript: 
* Extra error checking instead of runtime errors
* validate code 

## *.ts File VS *.js File 
* `*.js` -- JavaScript File
* `*.ts` -- TypeScript file
* TypeScript is a nice way of writting JavaScript code. Given that TypeScript cannot be executed by itself, as such `tsc` command is used compile the code into JavaScript and run it
* Either way, the code is ultimatly called via an HTML file. 

## JavaScrpt vs TypeScript example 
* [using-js.js](using-js.js) - Example of how to add 2 values in JavaScript 
* [using-ts.ts](using-ts.ts) - Example of how to add 2 values in TypeScript
* [using-ts.js](using-ts.js) - Compelation of TypeScript 
* [javascript_vs_typescript.html](javascript_vs_typescript.html) - HTML call to both JavaScript files in order to show difference in behavior
